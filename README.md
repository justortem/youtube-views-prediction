## Project overview   
  
Developing a regression model to predict the number of views on the next video of a YouTube channel based on the selected parameters.  
  
  
## Dataset  
  
Source: YouTube API-provided channel and video statistics of a given channel, able to be obtained via the application from an online source (aforementioned API) and able to be refreshed for added new information daily. 
  
  
## Analysis method categories:  
  
Regression Analysis;  
  
  
## Tools/programming languages:  
  
Programming language: Python;  
  
Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, Google API Python Client, google-auth (possible to be expanded);  
  
Tools: Jupyter Notebook (documentation/visualisation), PyCharm (editing/debugging);  
  
  
## Goals/objectives:  
  
Goal: Develop a regression model using YouTube API data to predict the number of views on the next video on a selected channel.  
  
  
## Intermediary objectives:  
  
•	Data collection: Get video data, channel statistics, and viewer engagement using the YouTube API.  
•	Data analysis and parameter selection: conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and select parameters that influence the number of views.  
•	Model creation and training:  
o	Generate a dataset with the selected parameters and number of views.  
o	Divide the data into training and test sets.  
o	Develop and train a regression model.  
•	Model performance evaluation: Use metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean square error (RMSE) to evaluate model quality.  
•	Interpretation of results and preparation of report:  
o	Analyze the model coefficients and their impact on the number of views.  
o	Prepare a report containing key findings and recommendations for the content creator.
